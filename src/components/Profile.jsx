          I have extensively travelled different countries and chose to make
          Canada my new home. I did my training and graduated at the Vancouver
          School of Bodywork and Massage.

        <h5>
          I enjoy connecting with people and helping them feel their best.
          Massages are like brain hugs - we all need one from time to time. I
          would love to be part of your wellness and self-care.
